## About Me

I'm currently pursuing my Ph.D. in the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.ucdavis.edu/) at the [University of California, Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/), under the guidance of Professor [Hans-Georg MÃ¼ller](https://anson.ucdavis.edu/~mueller/). Before landing at UC Davis, I earned my B.S. in Statistics from the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) in 2019.

## Research Interests

My academic focus lies in the advancement of statistical methodology and theoretical frameworks applicable to non-Euclidean data.

- **Random Objects:** Networks, distributions, and compositional data, with applications in brain imaging studies, multi-cohort studies, and traffic network analysis.
- **Functional Data Analysis:** Sparse functional data, particularly functional snippets, with applications in accelerated longitudinal studies.
