## About Me

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.ucdavis.edu/) at the [University of California, Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/), working with Professor [Hans-Georg Müller](https://anson.ucdavis.edu/~mueller/). Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. in Statistics from the [University of California, Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/) in March 2024, under the guidance of Professor [Hans-Georg Müller](https://anson.ucdavis.edu/~mueller/). Before coming to UC Davis, I earned my B.S. in Statistics from the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) in 2019.

## Research Interests

My academic focus lies in the advancement of statistical methodology and theoretical frameworks applicable to non-Euclidean data.

- **Metric-space-valued data:** Networks, covariance matrices, distributions, and compositional data, with applications in biological and social sciences, multi-cohort studies, and brain imaging studies.
- **Functional/longitudinal data:** Sparse functional data, particularly functional snippets, with applications in accelerated longitudinal studies.
